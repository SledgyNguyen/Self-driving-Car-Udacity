# Self-driving-Car-Udacity
All the different training data are stored in folder "stored_data". Before starting training, copy the data of a track from "stored _data" and paste to folder "images". There has already been a training data pack in images.

The pre-trained models are stored in folder "model". To use a model, copy it and paste to the main folder. There has already been a model (model-014-0.009287.h5) in the main folder.

Run the train.py to start training. The models are returned at the main folder.
To use the model, open the command prompt, direct to the main folder and type the following:

```bash
python drive.py model_name.h5
```

Replace model_name.h5 with the model that you want to use.

This project uses Tensorflow 2.1.0
